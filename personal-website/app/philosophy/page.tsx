          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            If you choose to do something, do it well. Go deep. Pay attention. Make it great.
            If you don&apos;t want to do it, don&apos;t start.
            Half effort wastes everyone&apos;s time.

          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            If someone is slipping, delivering low-quality work, or missing the mark, speak up.
            Don&apos;t hold back because you&apos;re scared they&apos;ll feel bad. Kindness won&apos;t feed the team. Clear and honest feedback will.
            Speak with respect and professionalism, but don&apos;t hide the truth.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-black dark:text-white">3. Talk Is Cheap. Show Actions. Actions Are Not Enough. Show Results.</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            You can tell me your plans. I&apos;ll listen.
            But I only count what you actually do.
            Show your results and the team will trust you.
            Be real with yourself. Are you moving forward or running in circles?
            If you want to rise here, it&apos;s simple. Show results.

          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            We follow a Darwinian mindset. People who adapt fast, work hard, and level up will thrive.
            No one gets special treatment. Not age. Not seniority. Not friendships.
            Your place in the team depends on your contribution, speed, and consistency.
            If you don&apos;t keep growing, the team will outgrow you.
            And that includes me. If I stop contributing, someone younger and hungrier should take my spot.

          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            We don&apos;t do this alone. We&apos;re here to win games together.
            Think like a football team. Strikers might get the spotlight, but the goal is to win the match.
            Support each other. Cover for each other. Push each other.
            That&apos;s how we beat the world.

          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Nothing is impossible if you push hard enough.
            But this isn&apos;t about being delusional.
            Life is short, so try. Give your best. Have fun. Stay upbeat.
            If it works, great. If not, that&apos;s fine too.
            But one thing is true: the person who keeps moving always gets what they deserve.

            The greatest enemy you must overcome is yourself.
