# Strategy and Vision: Personal Website

## 1. Executive Summary
This website serves as the digital headquarters for a builder, philosopher, and entrepreneur dedicated to rebuilding Myanmar. It bridges the gap between high-level philosophical thought and grounded, impactful execution. The site unifies the dual identities of "Builder" (Build Myanmar, TalentOS) and "Philosopher" (Buddhist philosophy, systems thinking, ethics).

## 2. Core Purpose
*   **Centralize Identity:** Consolidate the user's multi-faceted work (Build Myanmar, TalentOS, Writing, Speaking) into a single, cohesive narrative.
*   **Establish Authority:** Demonstrate thought leadership in nation-building, tech ecosystems, and ethical entrepreneurship.
*   **Signal Quality:** Use a "black and white, Apple-style" aesthetic to convey clarity, intentionality, and premium quality.
*   **Connect & Inspire:** Serve as a beacon for like-minded builders, thinkers, and potential collaborators.

## 3. Target Audience
*   **Global Tech & Business Leaders:** Investors, partners, and peers in the global startup ecosystem.
*   **Myanmar’s Youth & Builders:** The 5,000+ community members and aspiring entrepreneurs looking for guidance and inspiration.
*   **Intellectuals & Thinkers:** Readers interested in Buddhist philosophy applied to modern systems and ethics.
*   **Potential Talent/Partners:** People interested in joining TalentOS or Build Myanmar initiatives.

## 4. Core Narrative: "The Philosopher-Builder"
The central theme is **"Building with Intention."**
It’s not just about building companies; it’s about building *systems*, *communities*, and *nations* with a foundation in ethics and long-term thinking.
*   *Narrative Arc:* "I explore the deep questions (Philosophy/Writing) and answer them through tangible action (Build Myanmar/TalentOS)."

## 5. Visual & UX Principles
### Aesthetic: "The Focused Builder" (Reference Based)
*   **Layout:** **Left Sidebar Navigation (Right Aligned Text)**. A persistent, clean sidebar on the left (~120px wide). The text is right-aligned to "hug" the content margin.
*   **Palette:** Minimalist White/Black base.
*   **The "Highlight" Effect:** Use subtle, pastel-colored marker highlights (yellow, blue, purple) for key schools, companies, or entities in the bio text. This adds personality without breaking the clean aesthetic.
*   **Typography:** **Manrope**. Used for both headers and body. It gives a specific geometric yet friendly feel.
*   **Imagery:** Grid-based project thumbnails. Desaturated or high-contrast.

### UX: "Fast and Functional"
*   **Navigation:** Vertical sidebar. Hover effects transition from muted grey to black.
*   **Interactivity:** "Command+K" search palette using `cmdk`.
*   **Project Filtering:** Tabbed interface ("Everything", "Projects", "Communities") with **Framer Motion** layout animations (sliding pill background).
*   **Tone:** The copy should be direct and list-based (e.g., "some cool things I've done:").

## 6. Tone of Voice
*   **Philosophical but Grounded:** Deep thoughts expressed in simple words.
*   **Visionary but Practical:** Big ideas backed by "400K+ followers" and "largest ecosystem."
*   **Calm but Urgent:** The importance of the work is self-evident; it doesn't need to be shouted.
