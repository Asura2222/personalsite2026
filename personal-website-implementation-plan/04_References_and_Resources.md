# Links, References, and Context

## 1. Design References (Inspiration)
*   **Apple Design Resources:** (For spacing, typography hierarchy, and "breathing room").
*   **Minimalist Personal Sites:** Look at sites like *Paul Graham* (for essay focus), *Naval Ravikant* (for philosophical tone), or high-end design agency portfolios.
*   **Typography:**
    *   *Inter:* https://rsms.me/inter/
    *   *SF Pro:* Apple's system font (or closest web alternative).

## 2. Tools & Platforms
*   **Vercel:** Recommended for hosting Next.js.
*   **Framer Motion:** For the "calm" animations.
*   **Lucide Icons:** For minimal, clean vector icons (used sparingly).

## 3. Implementation Ideas
*   **Dark Mode?** The prompt specifies "Black and White" but implies a specific clean aesthetic. A toggle could be nice, but a "White background, Black text" dominant theme usually fits the "Apple-style" description better for reading, or a dedicated "Dark Mode" that is deep black/gray.
*   **Images:** Since I cannot generate the actual photos of you, I will use placeholders that can be easily swapped for the user's B&W photography later.

## 4. Content Strategy Note
*   The site relies heavily on *your* writing. The "Writing" section should be prioritized as a core engine of the personal brand loop.
